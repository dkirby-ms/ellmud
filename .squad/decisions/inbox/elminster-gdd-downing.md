# Decision: GDD §6.7 Updated to Document DowningSystem

**Author:** Elminster (Lead/Architect)
**Date:** 2026-04-04
**Status:** Executed
**Relates to:** #286 (GDD alignment — DowningSystem divergence)

## Context

The combat audit identified that the codebase has a `DowningSystem` (`packages/server/src/systems/DowningSystem.ts`) implementing a downed/bleedout/stabilization flow, while GDD §6.7 stated: "The player dies immediately. There is no downed state in the base system." This was a positive divergence — the implementation is better than what was designed.

## Decision

Updated GDD §6.7 to accurately describe the implemented DowningSystem mechanics:

- **Downed state:** 0 HP → incapacitated, not dead. Removed from combat. 10-tick bleed-out timer.
- **Stabilization:** `stabilize [player]` command, 2-tick channel, bandage required, cannot self-stabilize, interruptible.
- **Death triggers:** Bleed-out timer expiry OR finishing blow (active combat in room with downed player).
- **Stabilized protection:** Stabilized players are not subject to finishing blows.
- **Attribution:** killerIds tracked for PvP attribution.

Also updated cross-references in §8.3 (PvP) and §8.5 (Groups) to reference the downing flow.

## Team Impact

- **Minsc/Regis:** If building combat UI or tests, §6.7 now accurately describes the downed overlay state and stabilize interactions.
- **Future work:** Revive mechanic for stabilized players is not yet designed or implemented — stabilized players currently stay downed until encounter ends or zone collapses.
