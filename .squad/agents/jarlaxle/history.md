## Learnings

### 2026-03-19: PostgreSQL schema (Issue #3)
- Created 5 migration files under `packages/server/src/db/migrations/` (001–005).
- Player identity is normalized separately from player profile — `player_identities` table has provider/provider_id for OAuth bolt-on in Phase 4.
- Used GDD as source of truth for faction names (Ironwright Compact, Veil Cartographers, Scarlet Ledger) and skill categories (6 categories: combat, defence, survival, subterfuge, awareness, social) — the issue text had slightly different names.
- Item stats stored as JSONB for flexibility across item types.
- Faction membership enforces one-faction-at-a-time via UNIQUE constraint on player_id.
- TypeScript types in `db/types.ts` import GearTier, BiomeType, ShardTier from @ellmud/shared to stay in sync.
- DB connection module uses `pg.Pool` with `DATABASE_URL` env var. Migration runner uses a `_migrations` meta-table for idempotency.
- Pre-existing build errors exist in `state.ts` (@colyseus/schema missing) and client `vite.config.ts` — not related to this work.
