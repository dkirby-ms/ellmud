### 2026-04-01: Death & Spawn Routing — Faction Strongholds
**By:** Drizzt (Engine Dev)  
**Issue:** #238  

## Decision
Death routing and login routing now use faction-based stronghold resolution instead of hardcoded Refuge. Added `/api/spawn-zone` endpoint for client login routing.

## Routing Table
| Faction | Stronghold | Zone Target |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| ironwright | The Foundry | zone:the-foundry |
| veil | The Cartographium | zone:the-cartographium |
| scarlet | The Counting House | zone:the-counting-house |
| _(none)_ | The Refuge | zone:the-refuge |

## Architecture
- **Death routing** is server-authoritative: `resolvePlayerHubTarget(factionSlug)` on death, cached from `playerFactionSlugs` map
- **Login routing** requires client cooperation: `GET /api/spawn-zone` returns `{ target, zoneSlug, factionSlug }` — client must call before connecting
- **Narration** uses `resolvePlayerHubName()` to inject the specific zone name ("You awaken in The Foundry…")

## Impact
- **Regis (Frontend):** Client needs to call `/api/spawn-zone` on login and connect to the returned zone target instead of hardcoded `zone:the-refuge`
- **Jarlaxle (Systems):** Faction stronghold zones must exist and be registered for routing to work; falls back to Refuge gracefully
- **All:** The Refuge is now the fallback hub for unaffiliated players only

### 2026-04-01: Refuge Repurposing — Designer/Debug Hub
**By:** Jarlaxle (Systems Dev)  
**Issue:** #239  

## Decision
The Refuge has been recategorized from `hub` (player spawn location) to `dev` (designer/debug workspace). This shift reflects the architectural move to faction-based strongholds for player spawning and respawning.

## Rationale
Players now respawn at faction-specific strongholds rather than a universal hub. The Refuge becomes a dedicated development environment where designers can safely test new room templates, spawn creatures, and debug zone mechanics without impacting production gameplay. This provides isolation and clear purpose separation.

## Changes
- Database: Room category changed from `hub` to `dev`
- Type definitions: Updated `RoomCategory` union
- Descriptions: Updated to reflect designer/developer purpose
- Tests: 13 tests updated for developer workflow context

## Impact
- **Refuge as fallback:** Remains as emergency routing fallback for unaffiliated/unroutable players
- **Designer workflows:** Provides isolated test environment for zone design iteration
- **Admin access:** Unchanged; admin/designer tools continue to use Refuge
- **Player experience:** No disruption; players route to faction strongholds via `/api/spawn-zone`

### 2026-04-01: Insert Room on Exit — Zone Designer Pattern
**By:** Regis (Frontend Dev)  
**Issue:** #252  

## Decision
Added "Insert Room on Exit" as a new zone designer action. When an exit is selected, the user can insert a new room between the two connected rooms. This creates the room, deletes the original exit pair, and wires two new bidirectional pairs through the inserted room. The operation is atomic (all-or-nothing via try/catch) and the BFS layout engine naturally positions the new room on the grid between the originals.

## Rationale
Zone designers frequently need to add intermediate rooms to existing connections — for topological correctness (bridge rooms), narrative pacing, or encounter placement. Previously this required manually creating a room, deleting the exit, and rewiring 4+ exits by hand. The new button reduces this to a single click.

## Impact
- Button appears in both the exit-pair and single-exit panels in the zone designer side panel
- Hidden for cross-zone portal exits (portals span zones and shouldn't be split)
- New rooms default to type `corridor` — designer renames/retypes after insertion
- Uses purple dashed border styling (matching feature-room accent) to distinguish from Save/Delete actions
