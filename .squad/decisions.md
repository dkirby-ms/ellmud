### 2026-04-01: Insert Room on Exit — Zone Designer Pattern
**By:** Regis (Frontend Dev)  
**Issue:** #252  

## Decision
Added "Insert Room on Exit" as a new zone designer action. When an exit is selected, the user can insert a new room between the two connected rooms. This creates the room, deletes the original exit pair, and wires two new bidirectional pairs through the inserted room. The operation is atomic (all-or-nothing via try/catch) and the BFS layout engine naturally positions the new room on the grid between the originals.

## Rationale
Zone designers frequently need to add intermediate rooms to existing connections — for topological correctness (bridge rooms), narrative pacing, or encounter placement. Previously this required manually creating a room, deleting the exit, and rewiring 4+ exits by hand. The new button reduces this to a single click.

## Impact
- Button appears in both the exit-pair and single-exit panels in the zone designer side panel
- Hidden for cross-zone portal exits (portals span zones and shouldn't be split)
- New rooms default to type `corridor` — designer renames/retypes after insertion
- Uses purple dashed border styling (matching feature-room accent) to distinguish from Save/Delete actions
